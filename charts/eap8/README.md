# Helm Chart for EAP 8

A Helm chart for building and deploying a [JBoss EAP 8](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/application-platform) application on OpenShift.

The build and deploy steps are configured in separate `build` and `deploy` values.

The input of the `build` step is a Git repository that contains the application code and the output is an `ImageStreamTag` resource that contains the built application image.

The input of the `deploy` step is an application image (coming from the `build` output or from an external Docker registry) and the output is a `Deployment` and other related resources to access the application from inside and outside OpenShift.

## Prerequisites
Below are prerequisites that may apply to your use case.

### Pull Secret
You will need to create a pull secret to pull the EAP Builder and Runtime images from the Red Hat Container Catalog that requires authentication. Use the following command as a reference to create your pull secret:
```bash
$ oc create secret docker-registry my-pull-secret --docker-server=registry.redhat.io --docker-username=$USERNAME --docker-password=$PASSWORD --docker-email=$EMAIL
```

You can use this secret by passing `--set build.pullSecret=eap-pull-secret` to `helm install`, or you can configure this in a values file:

```yaml
build:
  pullSecret: eap-pull-secret
```

### Push Secret

You will need to create a push secret if you want to push your image to an external registry. Use the following command as a reference to create your push secret:

```bash
oc create secret docker-registry my-push-secret --docker-server=$SERVER_URL --docker-username=$USERNAME --docker-password=$PASSWORD --docker-email=$EMAIL
```

You can use this secret by passing `--set build.output.pushSecret=my-push-secret` and `--set build.output.kind=DockerImage`, or you can configure these in a values file:

```yaml
build:
  output:
    kind: DockerImage
    pushSecret: my-push-secret
```

## Application Image

The configuration for the image that is built and deployed is configured in a `image` section.

| Value | Description | Default | Additional Information |
| ----- | ----------- | ------- | ---------------------- |
| `image.name` | Name of the image you want to build/deploy | Defaults to the Helm release name. | The chart will create/reference an [ImageStream](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/openshift_images/image-streams-manage.html) based on this value. |
| `image.tag` | Tag that you want to build/deploy | `latest` | The chart will create/reference an [ImageStreamTag](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/openshift_images/image-streams-manage.html#images-using-imagestream-tags_image-streams-managing) based on the name provided |
