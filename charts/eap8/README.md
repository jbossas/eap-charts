# Helm Chart for EAP 8

A Helm chart for building and deploying a [JBoss EAP 8](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/jboss-middleware/application-platform) application on OpenShift.

## The Helm Chart for EAP 8 Beta is a Technology Preview feature only.

 Technology Preview features are not supported with Red Hat production service level agreements (SLAs) and might not be functionally complete. Red Hat does not recommend using them in production. These features provide early access to upcoming product features, enabling customers to test functionality and provide feedback during thedevelopment process. For more information, see [Technology Preview Features Support Scope](https://access.redhat.com/support/offerings/techpreview/).

## Building and Deploying Applications

The build and deploy steps are configured in separate `build` and `deploy` values.

The input of the `build` step is a Git repository that contains the application code and the output is an `ImageStreamTag` resource that contains the built application image.

The input of the `deploy` step is an `ImageStreamTag` resource that contains the built application image and the output is a `Deployment` and related resources to access the application from inside and outside OpenShift.

To be able to install a Helm release with that chart, you must be able to provide a valid application image.

## Build an Application Image from Source

If the application image must be built from source, the minimal configuration is:

```yaml
build:
  uri: <git repository URL of your application>
```

If the source repository is private, you must have a source secret created in the same namespace where you are building the application which allows athenticating to the repository.  Provide the name of the secret in the build section as follows:

```yaml
build:
  sourceSecret: <name of secret to login to your Git repository>
```

The `build` step will use OpenShift `BuildConfig` to build an application image from this Git repository.

The application must be a Maven project that is configured to use the [`org.jboss.eap.plugins:eap-maven-plugin`](https://github.com/jbossas/eap-maven-plugin/) to provision a JBoss EAP server with the deployed application. The application is built during the S2I assembly by running:

```
mvn -e -Popenshift -DskipTests -Dcom.redhat.xpaas.repo.redhatga -Dfabric8.skip=true --batch-mode -Djava.net.preferIPv4Stack=true -s /tmp/artifacts/configuration/settings.xml -Dmaven.repo.local=/tmp/artifacts/m2  package
```

Any additional Maven arguments can be specified by adding the `MAVEN_ARGS_APPEND` environment variable in the `.build.env` field:

```
build:
  env:
    - name: MAVEN_ARGS_APPEND
      value: "-P my-profile"
```


## Pull an existing Application Image

If your application image already exists, you can skip the `build` step and directly deploy your application image.
In that case, the minimal configuration is:

```yaml
image:
  name: <name of the application image. e.g. "quay.io/example.org/my-app">
  tag: <tag of the applicication image. e.g. "1.3" (defaults to "latest")>
build:
  enabled: false
```

## Working With Private Image Registries

If you are using private image registries to build, push or pull the application image, you need first to create secrets that will allow the container platform where the Helm Chart is deployed to authenticate against the private image registries.

### Pulling the Builder and Runtime Images from a Private Image Registry

This step applies if you build the image on OpenShift and need to pull the builder and runtime base images from an external private image registry.

You must first create a secret that contains the credentials to pull the base image (as explained in the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#specifying-imagepullsecrets-on-a-pod)) and reference it from the `build.pullSecret` field:


```yaml
build:
  pullSecret: my-pull-secret
```

### Pushing the Application Image to a Private Image Registry

This step applies if you build the image with the Helm chart and want to push it to an external image registry.

You must first create a secret that contains the credentials to push the application image (as explained in the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#specifying-imagepullsecrets-on-a-pod)) and reference it from the `build.output.pushSecret` field.
You also need to set the `build.output.kind` field to `DockerImage`.

```yaml
build:
  output:
    kind: DockerImage
    pushSecret: my-push-secret
```

### Pulling the Application Image from a Private Registry

If the application image comes from a private registry that requires authentication, you must first create a secret that contains the credentials to pull the application image (as explained in the [Kubernetes documentation](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#specifying-imagepullsecrets-on-a-pod)) and reference it from the `deploy.imagePullSecrets` field:

```yaml
image:
  name: quay.io/my-private-group/my-private-image
build:
  enabled: false
deploy:
  imagePullSecrets:
    - name: my-secret-quay-credentials
```

## Application Image

The configuration for the application image that is built and deployed is configured in a `image` section.

| Value | Description | Default | Additional Information |
| ----- | ----------- | ------- | ---------------------- |
| `image.name` | Name of the image you want to build and/or deploy | Defaults to the Helm release name. | The chart will create/reference an `ImageStreamTag` or a `DockerImage` based on this value. |
| `image.tag` | Tag that you want to build/deploy | `latest` | - |

## Building the Application Image

The configuration to build the application image is configured in a `build` section.

If the application image has been built by another mechanism, you can skip the building part of the Helm Chart by setting the `build.enabled` field to `false`.

| Value | Description | Default | Additional Information |

| `build.uri` | Git URI that references your git repo | &lt;required&gt; | Be sure to specify this to build the application. |

### Provisioning Jboss EAP With S2I.

The recommended way to provision the JBoss EAP server is to use the `eap-maven-plugin` from the application `pom.xml`.

The `build.s2i.featurePacks`,`build.s2i.galleonLayers`and `build.s2i.channels` fields have been deprecated as they are no longer necessary with this recommendation.

For backwards compatibility, the EAP S2I Builder image still supports these fields to delegate to the provisioning of the server to the `eap-maven-plugin` if it is not configured in the application `pom.xml`.
However if `build.s2i.galleonLayers` is set, `build.s2i.featurePacks` _must_ be specified (including EAP own feature pack `org.jboss.eap:wildfly-ee-galleon-pack`).

## Deploying the Application Image

The configuration to deploy the application image is configured in a `deploy` section.

If the Helm chart is only used to build the application image, you can skip the deploying part of the Helm Chart by setting the `build.deploy` field to `false`.
